The README describes the goal of the analysis. I want to take the breed_traits data, and then from the wikipedia page that lists dog breeds, pull a thumbnail and a description of each breed.

Add python scripts to `scripts` that do this.

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

* Ask questions to clarify any pieces of work that are unclear
* Use the uv CLI to add packages and create your venv
* Break the work into steps
  - Validate each step as you go
  - Preview sources and data where needed
  - Produce logs so it's clear what's failing
  - Save intermediate results for debugging and improvement
* Give a plan for what you want to do first, for confirmation
* You can ignore linter errors

DO NOT JUST WRITE AND THEN RUN SCRIPTS, CHECK WEBSITES AND DATA BEFOREHAND.
YOU CANNOT GUESS WHAT WILL BE IN A SOURCE AND THEN WRITE A SCRIPT.
YOU NEED TO OPEN AND INSPECT WEB PAGES BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO SCRAPE THEM.
